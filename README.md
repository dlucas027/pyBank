## Project Objective

This project aims to create two distinct banking systems in Python. The first, a simple system, does not use object-oriented programming and focuses on basic operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and account statements. The second, pyBank, is a more advanced version that implements object-oriented programming, offering similar functionalities but with greater control over transactions, limits, and a more robust structure. Both systems aim to provide a practical banking experience.
O sistema foi desenvolvido para simular a funcionalidade b√°sica de um banco, com foco em controle de saldo, limita√ß√£o de saques di√°rios e armazenamento de transa√ß√µes no extrato. Al√©m disso, o projeto possibilita que o usu√°rio interaja com o banco atrav√©s de um menu interativo, utilizando entradas de texto.

## Learning  

In this project, I learned a lot about the basic syntax of the Python language, as well as deepened my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The implementation of the banking system helped me understand how to create classes and objects, work with inheritance and encapsulation, and organize the code in a modular and scalable way.
Additionally, I had the opportunity to practice and improve my use of loop structures, such as for and while, to manage operations within the system, like transaction control and user interaction. With this, I was able to enhance my ability to structure efficient solutions and apply fundamental programming concepts in a practical way.

## Future Improvements  

In the future, I plan to integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) and add a feature that allows users to choose between a personal or business account.
